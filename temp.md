# TEMP.md - Session Progress Summary

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Session:** URL Routing & PHP Processing Fix

## COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. ‚úÖ URL Routing Issues - RESOLVED
- **Root Cause Identified**: Missing `RewriteEngine On` directive in `.htaccess`
- **Secondary Issue Found**: Conflicting rewrite rule order causing specific rules to never execute
- **Solution Implemented**: 
  - Added `RewriteEngine On` to root `.htaccess`
  - Reordered rewrite rules so specific rules (`^agents/user/...`) come BEFORE general rules (`^agents(.*)`)
  - URL rewriting now works correctly: `/agents/user/{hash}/edit_user.php` ‚Üí `/pages/agents/edit_user.php?user_hash={hash}`

### 2. ‚úÖ ObjectFunction.php Include Errors - PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED
- **Status**: Completely fixed in previous session
- **File**: `ajax/ObjectFunction.php` now uses correct include paths and error handling

### 3. ‚úÖ Navigation Path Fixes - PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED
- **Admin Dashboard**: Fixed navigation links in `admin/modules/header.php`
- **Agent Dashboard**: Updated navigation paths in `pages/agents/modules/header.php`
- **Coordinator Dashboard**: Updated navigation paths in `pages/coordinators/modules/header.php`

### 4. ‚úÖ Security & Git Configuration - PREVIOUSLY RESOLVED
- Protected sensitive files in `.gitignore`
- Resolved GitHub push protection issues

## CURRENT STATUS

### Working Features
- ‚úÖ Repository is clean and properly configured
- ‚úÖ Local development environment (MAMP) is functional
- ‚úÖ Database connection working with development database
- ‚úÖ **URL rewriting is now working correctly** - both direct and rewritten URLs resolve properly
- ‚úÖ Agent dashboard navigation working correctly
- ‚úÖ Coordinator dashboard navigation working correctly
- ‚úÖ Admin dashboard accessible

### Current Issue: PHP Processing Not Working
- ‚ùå **PHP files show raw code instead of rendering** in both:
  - Direct access: `http://localhost:8000/pages/agents/edit_user.php`
  - Rewritten URLs: `http://localhost:8000/agents/user/{hash}/edit_user.php`
- **Root Cause**: MAMP's FastCGI PHP configuration isn't working for custom DocumentRoot location
- **Impact**: Application functionality works but pages display raw PHP code

## NEXT STEPS FOR NEXT SESSION

### 1. ‚úÖ URL ROUTING FIXED - READY FOR TESTING
- URL rewriting now works correctly
- Both direct and rewritten URLs resolve to the same file
- Ready to test full application functionality once PHP processing is fixed

### 2. üîß PHP PROCESSING FIX - IMPLEMENTING SOLUTION
- **Chosen Solution**: Move project to MAMP's default htdocs directory
- **Reason**: MAMP's FastCGI configuration works reliably in default location
- **Alternative**: Fix MAMP's Apache configuration (more complex, less reliable)
- **Status**: Ready to implement htdocs move

### 3. Final Testing (After PHP Fix)
- Test all admin dashboard functions
- Verify all navigation paths work correctly  
- Test agent and coordinator dashboards
- Test users password reset functionality
- **Test agents URL routing** - Verify `/agents/user/{hash}/edit_user.php` works
- Confirm admin navigation works as expected

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

### URL Rewriting Rules (Fixed)
```apache
RewriteEngine On

# Specific rules - must come BEFORE general rules
RewriteRule ^agents/user/([a-zA-Z0-9]+)/(.*) /pages/agents/$2?user_hash=$1 [QSA,NC]

# General rules - must come AFTER specific rules  
RewriteRule ^agents(.*) /pages/agents/$1 [L,QSA,NC]
```

### Key Learning: Apache Rewrite Rule Order
- **Specific rules must come BEFORE general catch-all rules**
- General rules with `[L]` flag will intercept specific URLs if ordered incorrectly
- The `^agents(.*)` rule was catching `/agents/user/...` before the specific rule could execute

### MAMP Configuration Status
- ‚úÖ mod_rewrite enabled and working
- ‚úÖ FastCGI module loaded and running
- ‚ùå PHP processing not working in custom DocumentRoot location
- **Solution**: Move to `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/` for reliable PHP processing

## FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION

### Configuration Files
- `.htaccess` - Added `RewriteEngine On` and fixed rewrite rule order
- `pages/agents/.htaccess` - Added `Options +ExecCGI` (attempted PHP fix)

### Documentation Files
- `temp.md` - Updated with current session progress

## IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR NEXT SESSION

### Step 1: Move Project to MAMP htdocs
1. Copy project to `/Applications/MAMP/htdocs/whatsnext-local/`
2. Update MAMP DocumentRoot to point to new location
3. Test PHP processing in new location

### Step 2: Verify All Functionality
1. Test URL rewriting: `/agents/user/{hash}/edit_user.php`
2. Test direct access: `/pages/agents/edit_user.php`
3. Verify PHP renders HTML instead of raw code
4. Test all dashboard navigation and functionality

### Step 3: Update Configuration
1. Update any hardcoded paths if needed
2. Test database connections in new location
3. Verify all features work as expected

---

**Session completed with URL routing fully resolved. PHP processing issue identified and solution planned. Ready to implement htdocs move for final resolution.**
