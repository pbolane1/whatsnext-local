Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be more limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) for a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://downpaymentresource.com/are-you-eligible/\" target=\"_blank\">Check and see if you qualify for downpayment assistance</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hud.gov/states/california/homeownership/buyingprgms\" target=\"_blank\">List of CA Homeowners Assistance Programs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', '', 0, 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2022-06-08', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 1701117300, 1, 5, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0),

If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period, usually until they can find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"<a href=\"#taxsupp\" onclick=\"PopupClose();\">Supplemental Tax Bill</a>\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2022-06-08', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 0, 1, 0, 0),

Think of this as a jump start on the packing process.</span></p>', '<h2>Declutter &amp; Depersonalize</h2>\r\n<h3>Declutter</h3>\r\n<p>It\'s remarkable how much stuff people tend to accumulate over time. Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2022-08-25', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 10, 0, 155, 0, 0),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Think of this as a jump start on the packing process.</span></p>', '<h2>Declutter &amp; Depersonalize</h2>\r\n<h3>Declutter</h3>\r\n<p>It\'s remarkable how much stuff people tend to accumulate over time. Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove at least one-third of your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 2033, 0, 3, 85),

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 10, 79),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 3, 86),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>', '<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually.

Consider this: if you haven&rsquo;t used it in over a year, you probably don&rsquo;t need it. If you don&rsquo;t need it, it&rsquo;s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</span></p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p><span>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it&rsquo;s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don&rsquo;t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s recommended that you remove at least one-third of your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</span></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-02-22', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 9, 2033, 0, 3, 87),

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 3, 88),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 3, 89),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>', '<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-02-22', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 3, 90),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 3, 91),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>', '<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 8, 2148, 0, 3, 91),

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove at least one-third of your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage.

Think of this as a jump start on the packing process.</span></p>', '<h2>Declutter &amp; Depersonalize</h2>\r\n<h3>Declutter</h3>\r\n<p>It\'s remarkable how much stuff people tend to accumulate over time. Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove at least one-third of your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-03-04', 0, 'Peter Bolane', 'agent', 3, 0, 0, 1, 9, 2033, 0, 3, 93),

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-03-06', 1678133509, 'Paul Siebels', 'user_contact', 45, 1686699902, 0, 1, 6, 71, 0, 11, 80),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>', '<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 11, 94),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>', '<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-03-06', 1678133933, 'Paul Siebels', 'user_contact', 49, 1686699902, 0, 1, 6, 71, 0, 11, 95),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>', '<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-03-06', 1678140671, 'Paul Siebels', 'user_contact', 49, 1686699902, 0, 1, 10, 2148, 0, 11, 95),

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 7, 74),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>', '<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '0000-00-00', 0, '', '', 0, 0, 0, 1, 4, 71, 0, 1, 75),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-06-19', 1687200099, 'Pete Seller 1', 'user_contact', 59, 1687200303, 1687200106, 1, 10, 2033, 0, 1, 76),

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>', '', '', 'USER', 0, '', 'NONE', 'NONE', 0, 0, '2023-06-19', 1687215213, 'Paul Siebels', 'user_contact', 1, 1687215605, 1687215218, 1, 6, 71, 0, 7, 1),

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage.
