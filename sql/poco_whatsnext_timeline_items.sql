Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2022-06-08',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,0,1,0,0),(76,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2022-08-25',0,'','',0,0,1684449665,1,12,0,155,0,0),(2034,'TIMELINE','Complete Initial Title Paperwork','questionnaire2034_r.jpg','Complete Paperwork','fas fa-file-signature','<p><span>The title company requires that you fill out some initial paperwork so they can confirm your identity and start researching your property to see if there are any red flags that we can address now.

While all transactions (and offers) are unique, generally you will have a few ways out of the contract.</p>','<h2>Can I Back Out if My Offer Is Accepted?</h2>\r\n<p>Ultimately, it will come down to what is agreed upon in the contract. Generally speaking, during the first 17 days, you can back out of the contract for several reasons:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>Loan</span>: The bank decides they won\'t lend you the money.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>Appraisal</span>: The home does not appraise for the purchase price and no one wants to cover the difference.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span>Investigation of Property</span>: If you discover something that makes you nervous or don\'t like about the home.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2022-10-17',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,0,1,0,0),(2149,'TIMELINE','Check with Escrow about Final Closing Costs','make-call2149_r.jpg','Check with Escrow','fas fa-check','<p>Typically escrow waits to hear from the lender about final closing costs.&nbsp; If there is no lender, I\'ve found it prudent to reach out to escrow, remind them that there is no lender, and ask for an estimated settlement statement and final wiring instructions.</p>','','','','USER',0,'','closing_date','2',1,5,'2022-11-02',0,'','',0,0,1684451761,1,51,0,1,0,0),(2604,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Ask Lender for the Borrower(s) Birthday','birthday2604_r.jpg','Birthday','fas fa-birthday-cake','<p>You might consider reaching out to the lender and asking if they will give you the month and day of your client(s) birthdays.&nbsp; Then add that to your calendar so you can be sure to reach out to them and wish them a happy birthday.&nbsp; It\'s an easy way to keep in touch and staying top of mind with your client.</p>','','','','OTHER',1,'','contingencies_date','16',0,3,'2022-12-23',0,'','',0,0,1684448559,1,45,0,1,0,0),(2605,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Ask Title for the Seller(s) Birthday','birthday2605_r.jpg','Birthday','fas fa-birthday-cake','<p>You might consider reaching out to the title rep and asking if they will give you the month and day of your client(s) birthdays.&nbsp; Then add that to your calendar so you can be sure to reach out to them and wish them a happy birthday.&nbsp; It\'s an easy way to keep in touch and staying top of mind with your client.</p>','','','','USER',0,'','contingencies_date','16',0,3,'2022-12-23',0,'','',0,0,1684450618,1,60,0,155,0,0),(2625,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Review Home Warranty with Buyer','review-coverage2625_r.jpg','Review Home Warranty','fas fa-search','<p>Assuming there was a home warranty policy issued, it\'s a good idea to go over additional coverage options with the buyer.&nbsp; This protects you in the event something goes wrong in the future and the original home warranty coverage was lacking.</p>','<h2>Review Home Warranty with Buyer</h2>\r\n<p>Let\'s say that the seller offered a standard home warranty policy to the buyer, but the standard policy does not cover the roof.&nbsp; Six months later, the roof leaks and the buyer asks you what they can do.&nbsp; If you never presented them with the option of getting more coverage, they could come after you--or at the very least, be disappointed in your service.&nbsp; Go the extra mile for your client and review the policy, what it covers, what it doesn\'t, and let them decide (in writing!) if they want to pay for additional coverage.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, be sure to let your client know what the deductible is, and that if they have an issue, they will have to go through the home warranty company.

You are taxed differently depending on how long you have owned the home (more or less than 1 year).

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,10,2033,0,1,1),(2653,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Consider Ordering an NHD Report','defensible-space2641_r.jpg','','fas fa-file-alt','<p>It might be a good idea to order a Natural Hazard Disclosure report to investigate any potential fire hardening/defensible space issues.</p>','<h2>Consider Ordering an NHD Report</h2>\r\n<p>There is usually no upfront charge (although you should confirm with your preferred company) for ordering an NHD report.&nbsp; Ordering a report early allows sellers to know if they are in a high or very high fire hazard zone.&nbsp; If they are, you may want to address any issues or, in a counteroffer, include something like \"Buyer to assume responsibility for any fire hardening inspection after the close of escrow.\" Additionally, if the home is in a high or very high fire hazard zone, you may want to give the Defensible Space Decision Tree (C.A.R. form DSDT) in conjunction with the Fire Hardening Disclosure (C.A.R. form FHDS)</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.car.org/-/media/CAR/Documents/Transaction-Center/PDF/QUICK-GUIDES/Quick-Guide---Defensible-Space-52621.pdf\">Defensible Space Quick Guide</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/\">Cal Fire Website discussing defensible space requirements</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://wildfirerisk.org/\">wildfirerisk.org - US Forest Service Website</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,11,2641,0,1,1),(2654,'TIMELINE','Solar Panels','solar2638_r.jpg','','fas fa-sun','<p>Does the property have solar panels?

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings. This can help to identify any suspicious behavior or potential theft of personal belongings.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Protection</strong>: In case of any accidents or damage to the property during a showing, having footage from security cameras can provide liability protection and help determine who is responsible.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Homeowners may feel more at ease during an open house or showing if they have the ability to monitor the activity in their home remotely. You can check in on the visitors and make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to note that if you do choose to install security cameras during an open house or showing, we MUST disclose this information to visitors to ensure they are aware of the cameras and their presence is being recorded.

A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp; I look for a few key factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homes that are like yours (compare condo to condo not a condo to a home)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are nearby (less than a 1-mile radius without crossing a major road)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are similar in size (+/- 15%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then I compare features (location, number of beds and baths, upgrades, A/C, monthly HOA dues, year built, etc) and try to estimate what your home is worth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While most homeowners like to aim a little high, there is a lot of data out there to show that homes <em>slightly</em> under-priced receive more interest.&nbsp; More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,26,2145,0,1,1),(2669,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h1 class=\"entry-title\"></h1>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,27,2104,0,1,1),(2670,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;

You may also consider painting cabinets or updating a dark room with a new light and neutral color.&nbsp; Ask me for suggestions.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Knobs &amp; drawer pulls</strong>. If you have old knobs on the cabinets, this is a simple fix that can really help.&nbsp; Just make sure all the knobs and drawer pulls match.&nbsp; Typically brushed chrome or nickel works fine.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Replace curtains</strong>. If you have old, dirty or dark curtains, buy some new white ones.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Replace bedspread</strong>: consider replacing an old, worn bedspread. White linens are a classic choice.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Outlets and covers</strong>. Those old yellow outlets?&nbsp; Time to go.&nbsp; Replacing them with new outlets and faceplates is an affordable boost to your home&rsquo;s look.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Light Fixtures.</strong>&nbsp;If you have an old/dated light fixture, consider getting a replacement.&nbsp; Home Depot has some decent chandeliers and pendants for $100 &ndash; $200. If you don&rsquo;t have it, under-cabinet lighting is another affordable, quick fix.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Faucets</strong>. New kitchen and (primary) bathroom faucets can go a long way to upgrading the room\'s look.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Invest in curb appeal</strong>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve already trimmed the bushes and mowed the lawn (right?), now add some flowers for that extra touch. Mulch is another cheap and effective way to make the yard look great.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>Have a little more money to spend?

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,12,2033,0,1,2),(2728,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Consider Ordering an NHD Report','defensible-space2641_r.jpg','','fas fa-file-alt','<p>It might be a good idea to order a Natural Hazard Disclosure report to investigate any potential fire hardening/defensible space issues.</p>','<h2>Consider Ordering an NHD Report</h2>\r\n<p>There is usually no upfront charge (although you should confirm with your preferred company) for ordering an NHD report.&nbsp; Ordering a report early allows sellers to know if they are in a high or very high fire hazard zone.&nbsp; If they are, you may want to address any issues or, in a counteroffer, include something like \"Buyer to assume responsibility for any fire hardening inspection after the close of escrow.\" Additionally, if the home is in a high or very high fire hazard zone, you may want to give the Defensible Space Decision Tree (C.A.R. form DSDT) in conjunction with the Fire Hardening Disclosure (C.A.R. form FHDS)</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.car.org/-/media/CAR/Documents/Transaction-Center/PDF/QUICK-GUIDES/Quick-Guide---Defensible-Space-52621.pdf\">Defensible Space Quick Guide</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.readyforwildfire.org/prepare-for-wildfire/get-ready/defensible-space/\">Cal Fire Website discussing defensible space requirements</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://wildfirerisk.org/\">wildfirerisk.org - US Forest Service Website</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,13,2641,0,1,2),(2729,'TIMELINE','Solar Panels','solar2638_r.jpg','','fas fa-sun','<p>Does the property have solar panels?

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings. This can help to identify any suspicious behavior or potential theft of personal belongings.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Protection</strong>: In case of any accidents or damage to the property during a showing, having footage from security cameras can provide liability protection and help determine who is responsible.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Homeowners may feel more at ease during an open house or showing if they have the ability to monitor the activity in their home remotely. You can check in on the visitors and make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to note that if you do choose to install security cameras during an open house or showing, we MUST disclose this information to visitors to ensure they are aware of the cameras and their presence is being recorded. Additionally, it\'s important to respect visitors\' privacy and not record any audio without their consent.</p>\r\n<p></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-03-08',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,27,2642,0,1,2),(2743,'TIMELINE','Price Your Home Appropriately','accurate2145_r.jpg','','fas fa-bullseye','<p>Arguably one of the most important factors when it comes to selling your home, pricing your home appropriately is critical for a successful outcome.</p>','<h2>Price Your Home Appropriately</h2>\r\n<p>I\'m sure you likely grasp the dilemma here.&nbsp; Too high and you won\'t get as much attention.&nbsp; Too low and you are leaving money on the table.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There\'s a great quote in the \"Pricing Your Home to Sell\" article that is linked below:</p>\r\n<p><em>Market research should be your guide when pricing a home to sell, not your emotions. A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp; I look for a few key factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homes that are like yours (compare condo to condo not a condo to a home)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are nearby (less than a 1-mile radius without crossing a major road)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are similar in size (+/- 15%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then I compare features (location, number of beds and baths, upgrades, A/C, monthly HOA dues, year built, etc) and try to estimate what your home is worth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While most homeowners like to aim a little high, there is a lot of data out there to show that homes&nbsp;<em>slightly</em>&nbsp;under-priced receive more interest.&nbsp; More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-03-08',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,28,2145,0,1,2),(2744,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h1 class=\"entry-title\"></h1>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,29,2104,0,1,2),(2745,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,4,71,0,1,3),(2797,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,8,2148,0,1,3),(2801,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like).

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-04-05',1680730134,'Test Agent 1','agent',2,1680817802,1681167629,1,5,71,0,2,6),(3012,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn’t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat–i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-04-05',1680730134,'Test Agent 1','agent',2,1680817802,1681167629,1,8,2141,0,2,6),(3015,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.  Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-04-06',1680816140,'Paul Buyer','user_contact',4,1680817802,1681167629,1,9,2148,0,2,6),(3016,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations.

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-04-06',1680814610,'Paul Siebels','user_contact',5,1680817802,1681167629,1,12,2033,0,2,7),(3089,'TIMELINE','Solar Panels','solar2638_r.jpg','','fas fa-sun','<p>Does the property have solar panels?

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings. This can help to identify any suspicious behavior or potential theft of personal belongings.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Protection</strong>: In case of any accidents or damage to the property during a showing, having footage from security cameras can provide liability protection and help determine who is responsible.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Homeowners may feel more at ease during an open house or showing if they have the ability to monitor the activity in their home remotely. You can check in on the visitors and make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to note that if you do choose to install security cameras during an open house or showing, we MUST disclose this information to visitors to ensure they are aware of the cameras and their presence is being recorded. Additionally, it\'s important to respect visitors\' privacy and not record any audio without their consent.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cresinsurance.com/benefits-risks-home-video-surveillance-selling-property/\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">The Benefits and Risks of Home Video Surveillance When Selling a Property</span></a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/protect-privacy-selling-home/\">While Your Home Is on the Market, Protecting Your Privacy Is No Joke</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/videos/window-to-the-law/video-audio-surveillance-2022\">VIDEO:&nbsp;Video and Audio Surveillance Legal Issues</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-04-10',1681165682,'Paul Siebels','user_contact',5,1681165806,1681167629,1,26,2642,0,2,7),(3103,'TIMELINE','Price Your Home Appropriately','accurate2145_r.jpg','','fas fa-bullseye','<p>Arguably one of the most important factors when it comes to selling your home, pricing your home appropriately is critical for a successful outcome.</p>','<h2>Price Your Home Appropriately</h2>\r\n<p>I\'m sure you likely grasp the dilemma here.&nbsp; Too high and you won\'t get as much attention.&nbsp; Too low and you are leaving money on the table.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There\'s a great quote in the \"Pricing Your Home to Sell\" article that is linked below:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Market research should be your guide when pricing a home to sell, not your emotions. A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp; I look for a few key factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homes that are like yours (compare condo to condo not a condo to a home)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are nearby (less than a 1-mile radius without crossing a major road)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are similar in size (+/- 15%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then I compare features (location, number of beds and baths, upgrades, A/C, monthly HOA dues, year built, etc) and try to estimate what your home is worth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While most homeowners like to aim a little high, there is a lot of data out there to show that homes <em>slightly</em> under-priced receive more interest.&nbsp; More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-04-10',1681165682,'Paul Siebels','user_contact',5,1681166104,1681167629,1,27,2145,0,2,7),(3104,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h1 class=\"entry-title\"></h1>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,28,2104,0,2,7),(3105,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,2,71,0,2,8),(3166,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,7,2141,0,2,8),(3169,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,8,2148,0,2,8),(3170,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,4,71,0,1,9),(3238,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,7,2141,0,1,9),(3241,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681167629,1,8,2148,0,1,9),(3242,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations.

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-05-26',1685059424,'Test Agent 1','agent',2,1685133243,1685133021,1,4,71,0,2,10),(3308,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn’t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat–i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-05-26',1685135728,'Test Agent 1','agent',2,1685135823,1685135746,1,8,2148,0,2,10),(3312,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

Probably the number one thing you can do to get the home ready.&nbsp; A new coat of paint makes everything feel fresh and clean.

If you have old knobs on the cabinets, this is a simple fix that can really help.&nbsp; Just make sure all the knobs and drawer pulls match.&nbsp; Typically brushed chrome or nickel works fine.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Replace curtains</strong>. If you have old, dirty or dark curtains, buy some new white ones.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Replace bedspread</strong>: consider replacing an old, worn bedspread. White linens are a classic choice.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Outlets and covers</strong>. Those old yellow outlets?&nbsp; Time to go.&nbsp; Replacing them with new outlets and faceplates is an affordable boost to your home&rsquo;s look.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Light Fixtures.</strong>&nbsp;If you have an old/dated light fixture, consider getting a replacement.&nbsp; Home Depot has some decent chandeliers and pendants for $100 &ndash; $200. If you don&rsquo;t have it, under-cabinet lighting is another affordable, quick fix.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Faucets</strong>. New kitchen and (primary) bathroom faucets can go a long way to upgrading the room\'s look.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Invest in curb appeal</strong>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve already trimmed the bushes and mowed the lawn (right?), now add some flowers for that extra touch.

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-05-25',1685058956,'Paul Siebels','user_contact',9,1685059207,1685058963,1,12,2033,0,2,11),(3453,'TIMELINE','Solar Panels','solar2638_r.jpg','','fas fa-sun','<p>Does the property have solar panels?

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings. This can help to identify any suspicious behavior or potential theft of personal belongings.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Protection</strong>: In case of any accidents or damage to the property during a showing, having footage from security cameras can provide liability protection and help determine who is responsible.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Homeowners may feel more at ease during an open house or showing if they have the ability to monitor the activity in their home remotely. You can check in on the visitors and make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to note that if you do choose to install security cameras during an open house or showing, we MUST disclose this information to visitors to ensure they are aware of the cameras and their presence is being recorded. Additionally, it\'s important to respect visitors\' privacy and not record any audio without their consent.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cresinsurance.com/benefits-risks-home-video-surveillance-selling-property/\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">The Benefits and Risks of Home Video Surveillance When Selling a Property</span></a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/protect-privacy-selling-home/\">While Your Home Is on the Market, Protecting Your Privacy Is No Joke</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/videos/window-to-the-law/video-audio-surveillance-2022\">VIDEO:&nbsp;Video and Audio Surveillance Legal Issues</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-05-30',1685463474,'Paul Siebels','user_contact',9,1685465463,1685463485,1,26,2642,0,2,11),(3467,'TIMELINE','Price Your Home Appropriately','accurate2145_r.jpg','','fas fa-bullseye','<p>Arguably one of the most important factors when it comes to selling your home, pricing your home appropriately is critical for a successful outcome.</p>','<h2>Price Your Home Appropriately</h2>\r\n<p>I\'m sure you likely grasp the dilemma here.&nbsp; Too high and you won\'t get as much attention.&nbsp; Too low and you are leaving money on the table.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There\'s a great quote in the \"Pricing Your Home to Sell\" article that is linked below:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Market research should be your guide when pricing a home to sell, not your emotions. A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp; I look for a few key factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homes that are like yours (compare condo to condo not a condo to a home)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are nearby (less than a 1-mile radius without crossing a major road)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are similar in size (+/- 15%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then I compare features (location, number of beds and baths, upgrades, A/C, monthly HOA dues, year built, etc) and try to estimate what your home is worth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While most homeowners like to aim a little high, there is a lot of data out there to show that homes <em>slightly</em> under-priced receive more interest.&nbsp; More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-05-30',1685463474,'Paul Siebels','user_contact',9,1685465463,1685463489,1,27,2145,0,2,11),(3468,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1681851861,1,28,2104,0,2,11),(3469,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,166,2,0),(3521,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,168,2,0),(3590,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,168,2,0),(3593,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,168,2,0),(3594,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,170,2,0),(3659,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,172,2,0),(3728,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,174,2,0),(3797,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,174,2,0),(3800,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,174,2,0),(3801,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,176,2,0),(3866,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,176,2,0),(3869,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,176,2,0),(3870,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,178,2,0),(3935,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,180,2,0),(4004,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,180,2,0),(4008,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,182,2,0),(4073,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,182,2,0),(4076,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,182,2,0),(4077,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,185,2,0),(4142,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,185,2,0),(4145,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,185,2,0),(4146,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,187,2,0),(4211,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046100,1,4,71,188,2,0),(4280,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046100,1,7,2141,188,2,0),(4283,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate.

For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046100,1,8,2148,188,2,0),(4284,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates.

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046604,1,4,71,189,2,0),(4349,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046604,1,7,2141,189,2,0),(4352,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046604,1,8,2148,189,2,0),(4353,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046677,1,4,71,190,2,0),(4418,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046677,1,7,2141,190,2,0),(4421,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046677,1,8,2148,190,2,0),(4422,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,0,0,16),(4487,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,0,2,30),(4556,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,0,2,30),(4560,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like).

No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-05-25',1685055327,'Test Agent 1','agent',2,1685055605,1685055335,1,4,71,0,2,31),(4625,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn’t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat–i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,0,2,31),(4628,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.  Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'2023-05-25',1685055327,'Test Agent 1','agent',2,1685055605,1685055341,1,8,2148,0,2,31),(4629,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685137032,1,4,71,191,2,0),(4694,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685137129,1,4,71,192,2,0),(4763,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

If you don&rsquo;t have it, under-cabinet lighting is another affordable, quick fix.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Faucets</strong>. New kitchen and (primary) bathroom faucets can go a long way to upgrading the room\'s look.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Invest in curb appeal</strong>.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve already trimmed the bushes and mowed the lawn (right?), now add some flowers for that extra touch.

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684449665,1,12,2033,0,1,35),(4840,'TIMELINE','Solar Panels','solar2638_r.jpg','Solar Panels','fas fa-sun','<p>Does the property have solar panels?

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings. This can help to identify any suspicious behavior or potential theft of personal belongings.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Protection</strong>: In case of any accidents or damage to the property during a showing, having footage from security cameras can provide liability protection and help determine who is responsible.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Homeowners may feel more at ease during an open house or showing if they have the ability to monitor the activity in their home remotely. You can check in on the visitors and make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to note that if you do choose to install security cameras during an open house or showing, we MUST disclose this information to visitors to ensure they are aware of the cameras and their presence is being recorded. Additionally, it\'s important to respect visitors\' privacy and not record any audio without their consent.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.cresinsurance.com/benefits-risks-home-video-surveillance-selling-property/\"><span class=\"vcex-heading-inner wpex-inline-block wpex-clr\">The Benefits and Risks of Home Video Surveillance When Selling a Property</span></a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/protect-privacy-selling-home/\">While Your Home Is on the Market, Protecting Your Privacy Is No Joke</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nar.realtor/videos/window-to-the-law/video-audio-surveillance-2022\">VIDEO:&nbsp;Video and Audio Surveillance Legal Issues</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450215,1,26,2642,0,1,35),(4854,'TIMELINE','Price Your Home Appropriately','accurate2145_r.jpg','Price Your Home Appropriately','fas fa-bullseye','<p>Arguably one of the most important factors when it comes to selling your home, pricing your home appropriately is critical for a successful outcome.</p>','<h2>Price Your Home Appropriately</h2>\r\n<p>I\'m sure you likely grasp the dilemma here.&nbsp; Too high and you won\'t get as much attention.&nbsp; Too low and you are leaving money on the table.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There\'s a great quote in the \"Pricing Your Home to Sell\" article that is linked below:</p>\r\n<p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><em>Market research should be your guide when pricing a home to sell, not your emotions. A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp; I look for a few key factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homes that are like yours (compare condo to condo not a condo to a home)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are nearby (less than a 1-mile radius without crossing a major road)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are similar in size (+/- 15%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then I compare features (location, number of beds and baths, upgrades, A/C, monthly HOA dues, year built, etc) and try to estimate what your home is worth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While most homeowners like to aim a little high, there is a lot of data out there to show that homes <em>slightly</em> under-priced receive more interest.&nbsp; More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450222,1,27,2145,0,1,35),(4855,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','Reminder','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450234,1,28,2104,0,1,35),(4856,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','Final Home Preparations','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,0,2,37),(4909,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,0,2,37),(4912,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,0,2,37),(4913,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046677,1,4,4417,0,2,42),(5047,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046677,1,7,4420,0,2,42),(5050,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1685046677,1,8,4421,0,2,42),(5051,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you.

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage.

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings. This can help to identify any suspicious behavior or potential theft of personal belongings.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Protection</strong>: In case of any accidents or damage to the property during a showing, having footage from security cameras can provide liability protection and help determine who is responsible.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Homeowners may feel more at ease during an open house or showing if they have the ability to monitor the activity in their home remotely. You can check in on the visitors and make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to note that if you do choose to install security cameras during an open house or showing, we MUST disclose this information to visitors to ensure they are aware of the cameras and their presence is being recorded.

A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp;

More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450222,1,28,2145,0,2,43),(5561,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','Reminder','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450234,1,29,2104,0,2,43),(5562,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','Final Home Preparations','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684449665,1,12,2033,0,2,45),(5622,'TIMELINE','Solar Panels','solar2638_r.jpg','Solar Panels','fas fa-sun','<p>Does the property have solar panels?

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings. This can help to identify any suspicious behavior or potential theft of personal belongings.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Liability Protection</strong>: In case of any accidents or damage to the property during a showing, having footage from security cameras can provide liability protection and help determine who is responsible.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Peace of Mind</strong>: Homeowners may feel more at ease during an open house or showing if they have the ability to monitor the activity in their home remotely. You can check in on the visitors and make sure everything is going smoothly.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>It\'s important to note that if you do choose to install security cameras during an open house or showing, we MUST disclose this information to visitors to ensure they are aware of the cameras and their presence is being recorded.

A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp; I look for a few key factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homes that are like yours (compare condo to condo not a condo to a home)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are nearby (less than a 1-mile radius without crossing a major road)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are similar in size (+/- 15%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then I compare features (location, number of beds and baths, upgrades, A/C, monthly HOA dues, year built, etc) and try to estimate what your home is worth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While most homeowners like to aim a little high, there is a lot of data out there to show that homes <em>slightly</em> under-priced receive more interest.&nbsp; More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450222,1,28,2145,0,2,45),(5638,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','Reminder','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450234,1,29,2104,0,2,45),(5639,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','Final Home Preparations','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,0,4,55),(5691,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here. If you decide you want to sell your home first, it&rsquo;s usually more attractive to sellers if your home is already on the market (or even better, already under contract/in escrow) before making an offer.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/articles/personal-finance/111513/home-sale-contingencies-what-buyers-and-sellers-need-know.asp\" target=\"_blank\">How Home Sale Contingencies work and the pros and cons for buyers and sellers</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">How to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.upnest.com/1/post/home-sale-contigencies/\" target=\"_blank\">Need To Buy a House Contingent On Selling Yours?</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.homego.com/blog/how-to-buy-house-contingent-on-selling-yours/\" target=\"_blank\">4 Options to Buy a House Contingent on Selling Yours</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440716,1,7,2141,0,4,55),(5694,'TIMELINE','What about Property Taxes?','taxes2148_r.jpg','Property Taxes','fas fa-hand-holding-usd','<p>Property taxes are generally 1% of the assessed value.&nbsp; Assessed value is different from market value, but for some quick calculations, you can use a sales price as a rough estimate. So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill. This bill covers any difference in the new value of the home and the home\'s prior assessed value.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sdttc.com/content/ttc/en/tax-collection/secured-property-taxes.html\">Secured Property Taxes - San Diego Tax Collector</a></p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/sell/assessed-value-vs-market-value-difference/\" target=\"_blank\">Tax Assessed Value vs. Market Value: What&rsquo;s the Difference?</a></p>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440726,1,8,2148,0,4,55),(5695,'TIMELINE','Look For A Home','look-for-a-home1984_r.jpg','Look For A Home','fas fa-binoculars','<p>The exciting part!

We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance?

Getting pre-qualified is the first step.&nbsp; Getting pre-approved is even better. Your lender can guide you through the process.</p>\r\n<p>You will also have to show proof of funds when making a purchase offer, demonstrating you have enough money for the down payment and any out-of-pocket closing costs.&nbsp; Generally speaking, closing costs are around $3,000 &ndash; $5,000 plus impound taxes (property taxes, homeowners insurance, HOA dues, and the like). Your lender will be able to get you a better estimate of closing costs.</p>\r\n<p>In order to start the pre-qualification process, you will likely have to provide the following:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Self Employed</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Last 2 years of tax returns</li>\r\n<li>Copy of your most recent bank statement</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><strong>W-2 Employees</strong></p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>2 years of W-2 records</li>\r\n<li>Paystubs from the last 30 days</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>In addition, if, in the last two months, you have a deposit that is 50% greater than your normal gross income, be prepared to explain to the lender where that money came from.</p>\r\n<h3>Don&rsquo;t have a lender yet?</h3>\r\n<p>If you have been banking/investing at the same place for many years, this is an excellent place to start.&nbsp; They know you and can sometimes provide better rates. You can also shop around online for a competitive rate.&nbsp; If you need a recommendation for a competitive mortgage broker, please contact me and I will be happy to provide you with a few trusted lenders.&nbsp;<strong>For what&rsquo;s probably the largest purchase of your life, shopping around for the best terms is a good idea.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>When talking with a mortgage broker or potential lender, consider asking how many lenders they work with.&nbsp; Some mortgage brokers have access to many different loan programs, whereas if they only have access to one, your options may be limited.</p>\r\n<h3>Won&rsquo;t Multiple Credit Inquiries Hurt My Credit Score?</h3>\r\n<p>While this is a common concern, there is no need to worry.&nbsp; &nbsp;Multiple credit checks only count as a single inquiry when mortgage shopping, as long as you get the quotes in the same time period (usually within 14-45 days).&nbsp; Since you are making such a large purchase, it is a good idea to shop around and get a few quotes.</p>\r\n<h2>Comparing Lender Quotes</h2>\r\n<p>Often, buyers can get fixated on certain numbers in the loan process.&nbsp; Lenders know this and can try to lure you with bold claims. No closing costs! Super-low interest rate!&nbsp; The problem is, there is seldom a free lunch.&nbsp; Low-interest rates are often achieved by purchasing mortgage points. In essence, you pay a fee (1% of the mortgage per point) to get a lower rate.&nbsp; This makes sense if you are going to hold onto the property for a long time, but if not, you might end up actually paying more.&nbsp;&nbsp;Asking each lender for <strong>a loan estimate</strong> allows you to compare rates and fees to help you determine what will serve you best.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Additional Resources:</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankofamerica.com/mortgage/learn/mortgage-prequalification/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage Pre-Qualification vs. Pre-Approval</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/mortgages/credit-score-affects-mortgage-rate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How Credit Score Affects Your Mortgage Rate</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.realtor.com/advice/finance/big-bank-or-local-lender-for-mortgage/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Is a Big Bank or Local Lender Better for a Mortgage?</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://themortgagereports.com/22895/multiple-credit-inquiries-mortgage-rate-shopping\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Don&rsquo;t fear multiple credit inquiries when mortgage rate shopping</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mortgage points and how they can cut your interest costs</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-to-compare-mortgage-offers/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">How to shop for and compare mortgage offers</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684440639,1,4,71,0,2,57),(5760,'TIMELINE','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','be-mindful-credit76_r.jpg','Be Mindful Of Your Credit','fa fas fa-dollar-sign','<p><span>This isn&rsquo;t a good time to buy anything large, like a new car or boat&ndash;i.e. anything that requires a loan.

A <strong>rent-back</strong> in real estate refers to a situation where the seller of a property continues to live in the property after the sale has been completed, by renting it back from the buyer. This arrangement allows the seller to stay in the property for a specified period of time, usually until they are able to find a new place to live, while the buyer takes ownership of the property. Rent-back agreements are often included in the purchase contract and should be clearly defined and agreed upon by both parties before the closing of the sale.</span></p>\r\n<p><span><span>Another option is a bridge loan. A <strong>bridge loan</strong> is a type of short-term loan intended to \"bridge the gap\" between the purchase of a new property and the sale of an existing property. It provides interim financing, typically for a period of 12 months or less, with the expectation that the loan will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the old property. Bridge loans are often used by individuals to make a real estate purchase without having to wait for the sale of their existing property.</span></span></p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the most ideal, but also the toughest to pull off is a <strong>simultaneous/concurrent close</strong>.&nbsp;<span>A simultaneous close is when the closing of two transactions occurs at the same time. In real estate, it usually refers to the simultaneous closing of the sale of a property and the purchase of a new property. Both transactions are dependent on each other and must close on the same day. These can be tricky to time as delays (for either transaction) are not uncommon.</span></p>\r\n<p>Read over the resources and ask me about some options here.

So an $850,000 home would have about $8,500/year in property taxes or about $700/month.</p>','<h2>What about Property Taxes?</h2>\r\n<p>First, know that property taxes can be (and usually are) rolled into your mortgage payment.&nbsp; Mortgage payments usually consist of PITI or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>P</strong></span>rincipal (paying down your loan), <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nterest (based on your loan interest rate), (property) <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>T</strong></span>axes, and <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>I</strong></span>nsurance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>California\'s Prop 13 states that property values can\'t increase more than 2% annually. However, the property is reassessed whenever it <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">changes owners</span> or <span style=\"text-decoration-line: underline;\">undergoes new construction</span>.&nbsp; That change can be a 100% transfer or any fraction thereof. For fractional transfers, typically, it is only that fractional interest that has changed ownership and is subject to a new Base Year Value.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are exclusions (for parent/child transfers, grandparent/grandchild transfers, co-tenants, and more) and in those cases, you might not have to be re-assessed and can continue to pay the same tax you were paying.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, if you are 55 or older, Prop 19 allows you to&nbsp;transfer a base year value from one county to another county (but the replacement dwelling must be of equal or lesser value that is purchased or newly constructed within two years of the sale).&nbsp;So if you qualify and are moving to/from another county in California, you may well be able to take your tax base from your old home and keep paying that same rate, rather than 1% of the newly assessed home\'s value.</p>\r\n<h3>Supplemental Tax Bill</h3>\r\n<p>This is covered in more detail in the item named \"Supplemental Tax Bill\" but it\'s worth mentioning now.&nbsp; In addition to your property tax bill, you can also expect a one-time supplemental tax bill.

Normally this is 17 days, but depending on your lender, we might consider dropping it down to 10 days to make the offer more attractive.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Loan Contingency</strong>: The time frame for the lender to say they will indeed give you a loan for this home. Normally this is 17 days, but again, we may consider shortening this contingency period (if the lender agrees).</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Physical Inspection Contingency</strong>: the time frame allotted for your investigations. Normally 17 days.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Initial deposit</strong>: Typically this is 1% &ndash; 3% of the purchase price. 1% is low, 2% average and 3%+ is considered strong.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Down payment</strong>: 10% down? 20%? We will need to specify the amount on an offer.&nbsp; A larger down payment often looks more attractive for sellers, but depending on interest rates and your needs, a smaller down payment might be best for you. Note that the initial deposit counts towards your total down payment.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Proof of Funds</strong>: I&rsquo;ll need a copy of bank and/or investment statements showing that you have the money required for the down payment and closing costs&ndash;but be sure to redact any account numbers first.&nbsp;<span>Gifted funds are acceptable, you just need to provide the source of the gifted money.</span></li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Other</strong>: Termite clearance? Renters? Home Warranty?&nbsp; There are a variety of issues that we will need to address when writing the offer.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Typically, the sellers have 3 days to respond to your offer.

If the inspector turns up anything else (evidence of mold, for instance), you may consider hiring another inspector to perform additional tests.</li>\r\n<li class=\"double\"><strong>Reach out to your Lender:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The lender should provide you with a loan estimate that you will need to review and (assuming you agree) sign.

If you have old, dirty or dark curtains, buy some new white ones.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Replace bedspread</strong>: consider replacing an old, worn bedspread. White linens are a classic choice.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Outlets and covers</strong>. Those old yellow outlets?&nbsp; Time to go.&nbsp; Replacing them with new outlets and faceplates is an affordable boost to your home&rsquo;s look.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Light Fixtures.</strong>&nbsp;If you have an old/dated light fixture, consider getting a replacement.&nbsp; Home Depot has some decent chandeliers and pendants for $100 &ndash; $200. If you don&rsquo;t have it, under-cabinet lighting is another affordable, quick fix.</li>\r\n<li><strong>Faucets</strong>.

Consider this: if you haven\'t used it in over a year, you probably don\'t need it. If you don\'t need it, it\'s a good idea to consider donating or disposing of it.&nbsp; Just be sure to get a receipt from the donation center so you can claim a tax deduction later. Thin out your shelves and closets, leaving 1/3. Pack up those knickknacks. Clean off extra clutter from kitchen counters and around the home. Think of this process as a head-start on the packing you will need to do when you sell.</p>\r\n<h3>Depersonalize</h3>\r\n<p>If you have too many personal items in your home, potential buyers may find it harder to envision themselves living there. The goal is to create a neutral space where buyers can picture their own belongings, so it\'s best to remove your own photos from the walls. Artwork featuring nature scenes is generally acceptable, whereas family photos should be avoided. You don\'t want buyers to start wondering about the people who currently live there; instead, you want them to imagine themselves residing in the space. To achieve this, it\'s recommended that you remove your personal belongings. Consider storing these items away, either in a storage unit or in your garage. This includes family photos, collections, and other sentimental objects.</p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\">How to Declutter Your Home to Help It Sell Faster</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://professionalstaging.com/selling-your-home/how-to-declutter-your-home-to-help-it-sell-faster/\"><span class=\"fl-heading-text\"></span></a><a href=\"https://goodearthstaging.com/10-simple-decluttering-tips-for-home-staging/\">10 Simple Decluttering Tips for Home Staging</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/depersonalize-the-house/\">How to Depersonalize Your House for Sale Without Losing Its Charm</a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p class=\"fl-heading\"><a href=\"https://www.forsalebyowner.com/blog/expert-home-staging-tips-depersonalization\"></a><a href=\"https://info.creativehomestagers.com/blog/how-to-depersonalize-your-house\"><span class=\"hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_text\" data-hs-cos-general-type=\"meta_field\" data-hs-cos-type=\"text\">3 Ways to Depersonalize Your Home for Potential Buyers</span></a></p>\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684449665,1,12,2033,0,4,58);

The presence of cameras can make them think twice before attempting to commit a crime.</p>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>\r\n<p><strong>Monitor Activity</strong>: Having cameras set up can help homeowners and real estate agents monitor the activity of visitors during an open house or showings.

A buyer doesn&rsquo;t care what you paid for the house, the sweat equity you&rsquo;ve put into the property, the years of memories you&rsquo;ve created in the home, or how much profit you hope for.</em></p>\r\n<p>To that end, I will perform a comparative market analysis and see what homes are selling for in your area.&nbsp; I look for a few key factors:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Homes that are like yours (compare condo to condo not a condo to a home)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are nearby (less than a 1-mile radius without crossing a major road)</li>\r\n<li>Homes that are similar in size (+/- 15%)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Then I compare features (location, number of beds and baths, upgrades, A/C, monthly HOA dues, year built, etc) and try to estimate what your home is worth.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>While most homeowners like to aim a little high, there is a lot of data out there to show that homes <em>slightly</em> under-priced receive more interest.&nbsp; More interest means more potential buyers, which in turn can lead to more offers, and, ideally a quicker sale AND a higher final sales price.</p>\r\n<p>Some people often ask if we can start high and then lower the price if there isn\'t enough interest.&nbsp; While I have certainly tried this strategy before, I\'ve found it to be less successful than starting at a competitive number right away.&nbsp; If you drop the price, potential buyers sometimes are either turned off (there must be something wrong with the property) or smell blood in the water and want to lowball.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, we will need to look at your particular situation and examine current market trends to come up with the perfect number for your home.</p>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hgtv.com/lifestyle/real-estate/pricing-your-home-to-sell\" target=\"_blank\">Pricing Your Home to Sell</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.familyhandyman.com/list/15-things-to-know-about-how-to-price-a-house/\" target=\"_blank\">14 Things to Know About How to Price a House</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.homelight.com/blog/price-my-home/\" target=\"_blank\">Price My Home Right: Should I List My House High or Low?</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','USER',0,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450222,1,28,2145,0,4,58),(5853,'TIMELINE','AGENT ONLY - Work on your marketing materials','agent-reminder2104_r.gif','Reminder','fas fa-bell','<p>It\'s time to get started on your marketing materials to promote the home.</p>\r\n<p></p>','<h2>Work on your marketing materials</h2>\r\n<p>Here are some ideas to help you promote your listing:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Request mail file for \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Create \"Just Listed\" postcards</li>\r\n<li>Work on the property listing description (consider <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">using ChatGPT</a> to help you get started)</li>\r\n<li>Create door hangers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property flyers&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Create property website</li>\r\n<li>Prepare social media posts</li>\r\n<li>Schedule signpost installation</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have the correct sign rider</li>\r\n<li>Confirm you have a sign for the yard</li>\r\n<li>Gather open-house signs</li>\r\n<li>Consider putting a QR code on the signpost flyer box</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p></p>\r\n<h3>Resources</h3>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\">ChatGPT for Real Estate Agents: Never write a listing description again</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://brokeagentmedia.com/chatgpt-for-real-estate-agents-never-write-a-listing-description-again/\"></a><a href=\"https://predis.ai/\">Predis - Free Social Media Post and Video Generator</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva - Free Design Tool: Presentations, Video, Social Media</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://welcome.listreports.com/\">ListReports - Create free marketing kits&nbsp;</a></li>\r\n</ul>','','','OTHER',1,'','NONE','NONE',0,0,'0000-00-00',0,'','',0,0,1684450234,1,29,2104,0,4,58),(5854,'TIMELINE','Final Home Preparations','lockbox-12044_r.jpg','Final Home Preparations','fas fa-lock','<p><span>We are almost ready to officially put your home on the market.&nbsp;
