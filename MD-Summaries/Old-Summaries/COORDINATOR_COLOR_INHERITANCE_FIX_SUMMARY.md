# Coordinator Color Inheritance Display Fix

## Issue Description
When loading `agent/settings.php`, the "Coordinator Color Options" box was always displaying the message "üé® Your colors are currently inherited from Pete TC Test" even when the agent had different custom colors selected. Additionally, the reset button functionality was not working, making it impossible to test the inheritance logic.

## Root Causes
1. **Inheritance Display Logic**: The `RenderColorResetLinks()` method was checking if there was an inherited coordinator (`agent_colors_inherited_from`) but was not verifying whether the agent's current colors actually matched the inherited colors. It would show the inheritance notice whenever there was an inherited coordinator, regardless of whether the agent had customized their colors.

2. **Reset Button Functionality**: The reset buttons relied on an external JavaScript file (`colorReset.js`) that was not loading properly, causing the reset functionality to fail completely.

3. **Button Styling**: The coordinator buttons were incorrectly styled with purple colors instead of the original green.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Color Matching Logic
Created a new private method `ColorsMatchInherited()` that compares the agent's current colors with the coordinator's colors:

```php
private function ColorsMatchInherited($coordinator)
{
    return (
        $this->Get('agent_color1_hex') === $coordinator->Get('coordinator_color1_hex') &&
        $this->Get('agent_color1_fg_hex') === $coordinator->Get('coordinator_color1_fg_hex') &&
        $this->Get('agent_color2_hex') === $coordinator->Get('coordinator_color2_hex') &&
        $this->Get('agent_color2_fg_hex') === $coordinator->Get('coordinator_color2_fg_hex')
    );
}
```

### 2. Updated Display Logic
Modified the inheritance notice display conditions to only show when colors actually match:

**Before:**
- Show inheritance notice if there's an inherited coordinator
- Show inheritance notice if relationship is valid

**After:**
- Show inheritance notice if there's an inherited coordinator AND colors match
- Show inheritance notice if relationship is valid AND colors match

### 3. Fixed Button Styling
Restored the original green color for coordinator buttons:
- **Coordinator buttons**: Green (`#009901`) - as they were originally
- **Inherited buttons**: Green with special styling and "(Current Default)" badge
- **Site reset button**: Added with proper styling

### 4. Implemented Working Reset Functionality
Replaced the broken external JavaScript dependency with simple, inline JavaScript that:
- **Site Reset**: Resets colors to site defaults (`#009901`, `#FFFFFF`, `#000000`, `#FFFFFF`)
- **Coordinator Reset**: Resets colors to the selected coordinator's colors
- **Form State**: Marks the form as "dirty" to indicate unsaved changes
- **Preview Updates**: Triggers change events to update the color preview
- **User Feedback**: Shows success messages when colors are reset

## Behavior Changes

### When Agent Has Inherited Colors (Colors Match)
- ‚úÖ Shows: "üé® Your colors are currently inherited from Pete TC Test"
- ‚úÖ Shows: "Reset to Pete TC Test colors" with "(Current Default)" badge
- ‚úÖ Button appears with inherited styling (green with special indicators)
- ‚úÖ Reset functionality works and updates form fields

### When Agent Has Custom Colors (Colors Don't Match)
- ‚ùå Does NOT show: "üé® Your colors are currently inherited from Pete TC Test"
- ‚úÖ Shows: "Reset to Pete TC Test colors" button (without inheritance styling)
- ‚úÖ Button appears with normal styling (green)
- ‚úÖ Reset functionality works and updates form fields

### When Agent Has No Inherited Coordinator
- ‚ùå Does NOT show inheritance notice
- ‚úÖ Shows: "Reset to Pete TC Test colors" button (if coordinator is available)
- ‚úÖ Reset functionality works and updates form fields

### New Site Reset Functionality
- ‚úÖ Shows: "Reset to default site colors" button
- ‚úÖ Resets colors to site defaults
- ‚úÖ Updates form and preview immediately

## Files Modified
- `include/classes/c_agent.php` - Updated `RenderColorResetLinks()` method, added `ColorsMatchInherited()` method, and implemented inline reset functionality
- `css/global.css` - Fixed coordinator button colors back to green

## Testing
The fix ensures that:
1. Agents with truly inherited colors see the inheritance notice
2. Agents with custom colors only see the reset button
3. The visual styling correctly reflects the current state
4. No misleading information is displayed
5. **Reset buttons actually work** and update the form fields
6. **Button colors are correct** (green for coordinators, special styling for inherited)

## Impact
This fix significantly improves the user experience by:
- Providing accurate information about color inheritance status
- Preventing confusion about whether colors are currently inherited or custom
- **Making the reset functionality actually work** so users can test and use the inheritance system
- Restoring the correct visual appearance with proper button colors
- Adding a convenient site reset option for quick restoration to defaults
