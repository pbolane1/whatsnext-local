# Router Development Approach Summary

**TIMESTAMP:** December 2024  
**STATUS:** DOCUMENTED  
**PRIORITY:** Informational  
**CATEGORY:** Development Workflow  
**RELATED FILES:** `router.php`, `router-simple.php`, `test-router.php`, `.htaccess`


## Overview

This document outlines the local development router approach used in the WhatsNext Real Estate project and provides guidance on safely committing changes without router functionality interference.

## Current Router Implementation

## PETE NOTE: RUN THIS IN TERMINAL:
# Add to .gitignore
echo "router.php" >> .gitignore
echo "router-simple.php" >> .gitignore
echo "test-router.php" >> .gitignore
echo "launch.php" >> .gitignore

# Remove from git tracking if already tracked
git rm --cached router.php router-simple.php test-router.php launch.php
git commit -m "Remove local development router files from tracking"


### Files Involved
- **`router.php`** - Main development router (4.0KB, 141 lines)
- **`router-simple.php`** - Simplified router version (2.0KB, 79 lines)  
- **`test-router.php`** - Router testing file (258B, 8 lines)
- **`.htaccess`** - Production URL rewriting rules (3.9KB, 95 lines)

### Router Purpose
The router files are **local development tools** that replace `.htaccess` functionality when using PHP's built-in development server. They are designed to be used with commands like:

```bash
php -S localhost:8000 router.php
```

This allows developers to run the application locally without Apache/Nginx while maintaining the same URL structure as production.

## Router Functionality

### What the Router Does
1. **URL Rewriting** - Converts clean URLs to file paths
2. **Static File Serving** - Handles CSS, JS, images with proper content types
3. **PHP File Execution** - Routes requests to appropriate PHP files
4. **Error Handling** - Provides 404 responses for missing files

### Key Routing Rules
```php
$rewrite_rules = [
    'agents/?$' => 'pages/agents/index.php',
    'coordinators/?$' => 'pages/coordinators/index.php',
    'users/?$' => 'pages/users/index.php',
    'admin/?$' => 'admin/index.php',
    'ajax/(.*)' => 'ajax/$1',
    // ... static file handling
];
```

## Production vs Development

### Production Environment
- **Uses**: `.htaccess` file for URL rewriting
- **Server**: Apache/Nginx with mod_rewrite
- **Status**: Fully functional, no router dependency

### Development Environment  
- **Uses**: `router.php` for local development
- **Server**: PHP built-in server
- **Status**: Optional development tool

## Safe Committing Strategy

### Option 1: Exclude from Git (Recommended)

**Step 1: Update .gitignore**
```gitignore
# Local development router files
router.php
router-simple.php
test-router.php
launch.php
```

**Step 2: Remove from tracking**
```bash
git rm --cached router.php router-simple.php test-router.php launch.php
git commit -m "Remove local development router files from tracking"
```

**Benefits:**
- Clean repository without development-only files
- No risk of router files affecting production
- Follows standard practice of excluding local dev tools

### Option 2: Keep in Git (Team Sharing)

**Approach:** Commit router files as-is
- **Risk Level**: None - files are completely independent
- **Production Impact**: Zero - files are never executed by main application
- **Team Benefit**: Other developers can use the same local setup

## Application Independence

### No Dependencies
The router files are **completely standalone** and have no integration with:
- `index.php` - Main application entry point
- `include/common.php` - Core system configuration
- Any user-facing functionality
- Database operations or business logic

### File Isolation
- **Router files**: Handle HTTP requests and routing
- **Application files**: Handle business logic and data
- **No shared state or communication between them**

## Testing the Approach

### Before Committing
1. **Verify router independence**:
   ```bash
   # Remove router files temporarily
   mv router.php router.php.backup
   
   # Test application functionality
   # Should work exactly the same
   ```

2. **Check production readiness**:
   - `.htaccess` file contains all necessary rewrite rules
   - Application URLs work without router
   - No broken links or 404 errors

### After Committing
1. **Production deployment**: No changes needed
2. **Local development**: Can still use router if needed
3. **Team workflow**: Unaffected by router presence/absence

## Best Practices

### For Local Development
- Use router files for convenient local testing
- Keep router files in a separate development branch if needed
- Document router usage in team development guide

### For Production
- Rely on `.htaccess` for URL rewriting
- Never reference router files in production code
- Maintain `.htaccess` rules for all application routes

### For Git Management
- Choose one approach and stick with it
- Document the chosen approach in team documentation
- Ensure all team members understand the strategy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Router file accidentally committed**
```bash
# Remove from git but keep locally
git rm --cached router.php
git commit -m "Remove router.php from tracking"
```

**Production routing broken**
- Check `.htaccess` file exists and is readable
- Verify mod_rewrite is enabled on server
- Test rewrite rules manually

**Local development not working**
- Ensure PHP built-in server is running with router
- Check router file syntax and permissions
- Verify router file is in correct location

## Conclusion

The router files are completely independent development tools that can be safely excluded from git commits without affecting application functionality. The production environment relies entirely on `.htaccess` for URL rewriting, making the router files optional for local development only.

**Recommendation**: Exclude router files from git tracking to maintain a clean repository while preserving local development capabilities.
