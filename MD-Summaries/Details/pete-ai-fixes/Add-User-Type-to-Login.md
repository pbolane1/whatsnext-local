# Add User Type to Login Headlines

**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Type:** User Experience Enhancement  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  
**Branch:** pete-ai-fixes  

## Issue Summary

The login pages across different sections of the WhatsNext application were displaying generic "Login" headlines, making it unclear which section users were accessing. This created confusion and poor user experience, especially when users navigate between different user types (agents, coordinators, users, admins). The issue affected not just the main index pages, but also all sub-pages within each section.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in the `$__headline__` variable assignments across multiple files in each section:

1. **Agent Section** (`pages/agents/*.php`): Most pages used generic "Login" when not logged in
2. **Coordinator Section** (`pages/coordinators/*.php`): Most pages used generic "Login" when not logged in  
3. **User Section** (`pages/users/*.php`): Most pages used generic "Login" when not logged in
4. **Admin Section** (`admin/*.php`): Most pages had no headline variable set for login state

## Technical Implementation Details

### Headline Variable Logic
Each section now uses conditional logic to display appropriate headlines:

- **When logged in:** Shows the section's main dashboard/functionality name
- **When not logged in:** Shows the specific login message for that user type

### User Experience Flow
1. User navigates to any section (e.g., `/agents`, `/coordinators`, `/users`, `/admin`)
2. If not logged in, they see the specific login message (e.g., "Agent Login", "Manager Login")
3. If logged in, they see the section's main functionality name
4. Headlines are consistent and descriptive across all sections

## Testing and Validation

### Test Scenarios
1. **Agent Section Logout:** Navigate to `/pages/agents/index.php?action=logout`
   - Expected: Page header shows "Agent Login"
   - Result: ✅ Working correctly

2. **Coordinator Section Logout:** Navigate to `/pages/coordinators/index.php?action=logout`
   - Expected: Page header shows "Manager Login"
   - Result: ✅ Working correctly

3. **User Section Logout:** Navigate to `/pages/users/index.php?action=logout`
   - Expected: Page header shows "Client Login"
   - Result: ✅ Working correctly

4. **Admin Section Logout:** Navigate to `/admin/index.php?action=logout`
   - Expected: Page header shows "Admin Login"
   - Result: ✅ Working correctly
