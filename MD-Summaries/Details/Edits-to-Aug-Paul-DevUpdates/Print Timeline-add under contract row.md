# Print Timeline Under Contract Section Header Enhancement
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Type:** Feature Enhancement  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  

## Overview
Enhanced the Print Timeline functionality to include a clear visual section header that indicates when timeline items are under contract. Added a full-width "UNDER CONTRACT" banner row that appears before the "Contract Begins" timeline item, creating better document organization and professional appearance for printed timeline documents.

## Problem Statement
The original Print Timeline feature displayed all timeline items in a continuous list without clear visual separation between different phases of the transaction. This made it difficult to:
- Identify when the contract phase begins
- Distinguish between pre-contract and contract-related tasks
- Create organized, professional-looking printed documents
- Provide clear visual cues for client meetings

## Solution Implemented
Added a conditional "UNDER CONTRACT" banner row that:
- **Appears only when the user is under contract** - Uses `$user->Get('user_under_contract')` check
- **Positioned strategically** - Placed right before the "Contract Begins" timeline item
- **Full-width display** - Spans all 4 columns with `colspan='4'`
- **Consistent styling** - Uses the same `agent_bg_color1` class as other headers
- **Professional appearance** - Centered, bold text for clear visibility

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `include/traits/t_transaction_handler.php` - Modified the `PrintTimeline` method

### Code Changes
**Before:**
```php
foreach($list->items as $timeline_item)
{
    $d=new DBDate($timeline_item->Get('timeline_item_date'));
    $d2=new date();
    $d2->SetTimestamp($timeline_item->Get('timeline_item_complete'));
    
    echo("<tr>");
    echo("<td>".$timeline_item->Get('timeline_item_title')."</td>");
```

**After:**
```php
foreach($list->items as $timeline_item)
{
    $d=new DBDate($timeline_item->Get('timeline_item_date'));
    $d2=new date();
    $d2->SetTimestamp($timeline_item->Get('timeline_item_complete'));
    
    // Add UNDER CONTRACT row before Contract Begins
    if($timeline_item->Get('timeline_item_title') == 'Contract Begins' && $user->Get('user_under_contract'))
    {
        echo("<tr class='agent_bg_color1'><td colspan='4' style='text-align:center;font-weight:bold;'>UNDER CONTRACT</td></tr>");
    }
    
    echo("<tr>");
    echo("<td>".$timeline_item->Get('timeline_item_title')."</td>");
```

### Implementation Logic
1. **Conditional Check**: Only displays when `user_under_contract` is true
2. **Specific Item Detection**: Looks for timeline item with title "Contract Begins"
3. **Strategic Placement**: Inserts the banner row immediately before the target item
4. **Full-Width Display**: Uses `colspan='4'` to span all table columns
5. **Consistent Styling**: Applies `agent_bg_color1` class for visual consistency

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Enhancement
- All timeline items appeared in a continuous list
- No visual separation between transaction phases
- Difficult to identify when contract phase begins
- Less organized appearance for printed documents

### After Enhancement
- Clear visual section header for contract-related tasks
- Better document organization and readability
- Professional appearance for client meetings
- Easy identification of contract phase timeline items

## Visual Layout
The enhanced Print Timeline now displays:
1. **Row 1**: `[Client Name] - [Property Address]` (spanning all columns)
2. **Row 2**: `TO DO | DUE DATE | AGENT COMPLETED | CLIENT COMPLETED`
3. **Row 3+**: Timeline items with "UNDER CONTRACT" banner appearing before "Contract Begins"

## CSS Styling
The "UNDER CONTRACT" row inherits existing styling:
- Uses `.agent_bg_color1` class for consistent appearance
- Spans all 4 columns with `colspan='4'`
- Additional inline styles for centering and bold text
- Maintains visual hierarchy with existing design

## Conditional Display
The enhancement is smart about when to show the banner:
- **Shows**: Only when user has `user_under_contract` set to true
- **Hides**: When user is not under contract (no banner displayed)
- **Positioned**: Right before the "Contract Begins" timeline item
- **Contextual**: Appears at the appropriate point in the timeline flow

## Testing
The enhancement was tested by:
1. Accessing timeline page for a user under contract
2. Clicking the "Print Timeline" button
3. Verifying "UNDER CONTRACT" banner appears before "Contract Begins"
4. Testing with users not under contract (banner should not appear)
5. Confirming proper formatting in print preview

## Future Considerations
Potential enhancements that could be added:
- Additional section headers for other transaction phases
- Configurable banner text and styling
- Multiple phase indicators (e.g., "PRE-CONTRACT", "CLOSING")
- Custom styling options for different transaction types
- Integration with timeline item categories or tags

## Files Created
- This detailed documentation file
- Updated PETE-UPDATES.md with additional enhancement summary

## Conclusion
This enhancement significantly improves the organization and professional appearance of the Print Timeline feature. Real estate agents can now clearly identify when the contract phase begins, making printed timeline documents more organized and easier to present to clients. The implementation is clean, maintainable, and follows existing code patterns while providing immediate visual improvements.

## Related Enhancements
This enhancement builds upon the previous Print Timeline improvements, creating a comprehensive enhancement to the overall print functionality:
1. **Header Enhancement**: Added client name and property address identification
2. **Date Format Enhancement**: Improved date readability and professional appearance
3. **Section Header Enhancement**: Added clear visual separation for contract phase

Together, these enhancements create a much more professional, organized, and user-friendly printed timeline document that clearly communicates the transaction structure to clients and agents.
