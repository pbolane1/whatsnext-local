# Remove Legacy Buyer Questionnaire Modal from Footer
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Type:** Code Cleanup & Bug Fix  
**Status:** Completed  
**Priority:** MEDIUM  

## Overview
Successfully identified and removed legacy "Home Buyer Questionnaire" modal code that was appearing at the bottom of the users page, causing display issues and cluttering the interface.

## Problem Description
Users reported seeing a legacy modal at the bottom of the `/users` page that contained:
- A "Home Buyer Questionnaire" form
- Multiple form fields for buyer information
- JavaScript functions for modal functionality
- Form submission to a non-existent `send_questionnaire.php` file

The modal was causing:
- Interface clutter
- Potential confusion for users
- Unused legacy code maintenance overhead
- Display issues with the page layout

## Root Cause Analysis
The modal was being included in the users page through:
```php
<?php include('../../modules/buyer-questionnaire.html'); ?>
```

This include was located in `pages/users/index.php` and was bringing in the entire modal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Include Statement
- **File:** `pages/users/index.php`
- **Change:** Removed the line `<?php include('../../modules/buyer-questionnaire.html'); ?>`
- **Location:** Line 63, after footer includes

### 2. Deleted Legacy Files
- **File:** `modules/buyer-questionnaire.html` - Complete modal implementation
- **File:** `modules/send_questionnaire.php` - Form processing script

### 3. Verified No Other References
- Scanned `/admin`, `/agents`, `/coordinators`, and `/users` directories
- Confirmed no other files were including the questionnaire module
- Verified no JavaScript functions or CSS classes were referenced elsewhere

## Files Modified

### Deleted Files
- `modules/buyer-questionnaire.html` - Modal HTML/CSS/JS implementation
- `modules/send_questionnaire.php` - Form processing script

### Modified Files
- `pages/users/index.php` - Removed include statement

## Code Changes

### Before (pages/users/index.php)
```php
<?php include ('modules/footer.php');?>
<?php include ('../../modules/footer_scripts.php');?>
<?php include ('modules/footer_scripts.php');?>
<?php include('../../modules/buyer-questionnaire.html'); ?>  <!-- REMOVED -->

</body>
</html>
```

### After (pages/users/index.php)
```php
<?php include ('modules/footer.php');?>
<?php include ('../../modules/footer_scripts.php');?>
<?php include ('modules/footer_scripts.php');?>

</body>
</html>
```
